Dear students,

I have received the same question from several of you regarding the final project, so please find below a clarification applicable to everyone.

The [LungCancerDetection GitHub repository](https://github.com/schaudhuri16/LungCancerDetection) referenced in the project description contains **only a README file** describing the methods and overall approach without any ready-to-use code or notebooks. This is expected and deliberate.

It is therefore **your responsibility** to:

*   either implement the mentioned classification models yourself (or equivalent ones),
    
*   or reuse **existing pre-trained models trained on the same dataset**, which you can find through basic technical or bibliographic research.
    

The choice is entirely yours:

*   training your own models or
    
*   reusing pre-trained models developed by others **provided they are properly used and correctly referenced**.
    
*   or both.
    

**Note:** _If you reuse pre-trained models, existing implementations or techniques developed by others you must clearly cite and reference the original sources (papers, repositories or authors) in your report and documentation._

The main objective of the project is to **refactor and merge 2 different GitHub repositories into a single application**. You are expected to combine ideas and components from both repositories to produce a unified interface that allows:

*   selecting an input file,
    
*   choosing a classification algorithm,
    
*   explaining the obtained prediction (e.g. using Grad-CAM or any compatible explainability method accroding to the input format).
    

The repositories provided are **starting points and conceptual references** not complete solutions.

Please note that this is a **5th-year project**. We are **not in kindergarten** (**in french/maternelle**) and it is neither expected nor appropriate for all solutions to be provided to you step by step. At this level autonomy, initiative and the ability to search, analyze and make technical decisions are part of the learning objectives.

You are expected to take responsibility for your implementation choices, justify them clearly and work independently within your group. Remember that you are allowed to form groups of **up to 5 students** which should help you manage the workload efficiently.

What will be evaluated in priority:

*   compliance with the project specifications,
    
*   your ability to successfully merge 2 distinct repositories into a coherent application,
    
*   the relevance and justification of your technical choices.
    

The exact implementation strategy is deliberately left to your judgment.

Best regards
